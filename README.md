### NICHOLAS ATKINSON PHOTOGRAPHY PORTFOLIO REACT APP
----------------------------------------------------

This is a personal portfolio react app that I have made to display the photos that I take.

## MADE WITH
 - React js library
 - CSS
 - JSX
 - HTML

## CHALLENGES
This has been my first react app that I have created from the ground up with no guidance. The led to a lot of personal challenges:
 - Managing file structure was certainly one, as I dealt with a lot more files than a static website. 
 - I have had a hard time navigating the relationship between CSS and JSX. This is an area that I am not sure I nailed with this project; however, it is at least functional. 
 - Finding brake points and implementing necessary media queries is always a challenge.
